Task:
Implement a catalog of articles. The directory contains named subdirectories, which may include other subdirectories or articles. The article has a title and text. The application should provide the ability to navigate directories, add / edit / delete directories and articles. Directory mapping should be tree-like.
Separation of rights should be implemented (authorized, not authorized user): only authorized can edit. The result of editing should be displayed asynchronously, without reloading the page.
